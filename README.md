# Sports League Simulator

Welcome to the **Sports League Simulator**! 

🏆 This project was developed as part of a **Software Engineering** exam and implements a sports championship simulation using **design patterns**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This Java application simulates the progress of a sports championship to evaluate the effectiveness of a coach. The program models a **sports organization** where:
- Teams participate in a **league divided into categories** (Juniores, Seniores).
- A **coach** prepares training sessions based on match outcomes.
- A **doctor** observes and records player injuries.
- A **president** manages the staff and makes decisions for the following season.

## 🎯 Design Patterns Used
This project applies three major **design patterns**:
- **Strategy** 🏟️: To handle different league categories and match logic.
- **Observer** 👀: To notify doctors about player injuries.
- **Singleton** 🔄: To ensure there is only one instance of the president.

## 🛠 Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- **Java 11+**
- **JUnit 5** (for testing)
- An IDE such as **Eclipse** or **IntelliJ IDEA**

## 🤝 Contributions
This project was created by Giovanni Stefanini as part of a Software Engineering exam and is shared for educational purposes.
